#Opportunity lost **OL**
> __Definition:__ This is the lost opportunity associated with making a decision.

When using an **opportunity lost** OL table, BAYES' rule now recommends making the decision with the lowest **expected** opportunity lost. _ie: in problem 2) stock 6._

There is also another rule for **OL** table called: **minimax rule**

> **Minimax**: take the best of the worth **OL** for each decision _ie in problem 2) stock 7._

## Perfect Information (Forecast) **PI**

The total of each decision of it's **expected payoff** and it's **expected opportunity lost** is always the same no mater what the decision. In the case of _problem 2)_ : 212
**Perfect Information** is the situation where (unrealistically) you have access to a perfect forecast for the different demand levels. The number _here in problem 2)_ 212 is called **Expected Payoff from Perfect Information** (EPPI)
From this value (EPPI), we can obtain something useful, called **EVPI** (**V** for Value / gain) as follows: take EPPI and subtract the best expected payoff in the payoff table _ie problem 2): 212 - 203.6 = 8.4; **EVPI** = 8.4_
EPPI always appear for free as the lowest expected opportunity (**pOL**) in the **OL** table.
This value **EVPI** gives us an upper limit on how much to pay for forecast in the long one.

# Probability (Bayesian) _aka: revising probability_

## Basics
1. 0 <= P(A) <= 1 means probability of a is included between 0 and 1
2. P(A) = 0 : A is impossible
3. P(A) = 1 : A is certain
4. P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
5. P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
6. P(A | B) = probability of A occurring given that B occurring

## Problem 1

|  1000	|   High	|   Low	|   People out of 1000 that have +ive or -ive	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
|  +ive 	|  9 	|   99	|   108	|
|   -ive	|   1	|   891	|   	892|
|   People out pf 100 having High or Low	|  10 	|   990	|   	|

P(HIGH | +ive) = 9 / 108 = 0.083

Upon taking the test, the chances that a person shows positive is:
`P(+ive) = 108/1000 = 0.108`
within 108 people, 9 actually have high cholesterol
`P(HIGH | +ive) = 9 / 108 = 0.083`
This answer can be viewed in two opposites ways:

1. In absolute terms, 0.083 is a small probability therefore no need to worries
2. but in relative terms it is 8 times more likely than the original probability 0.01 (which is not a good things)

## Probability trees

The above problem can be solved with the **probability trees**

The tree structure is always started by the probability that is being revised.
_eg in the above problem: chance of high cholesterol 0.01; but once showing up positive this 0.01 was revised up to 0.083  

   (i) P(+ive) = 0.009 + 0.99 = 0.108
(ii) P(High | +ive) = (0.009) / (0.009 + 0.099) = 0.083

**Insert Problem 3**
**Insert Problem 9**

**Insert Problem 15**

The above result is not very useful because it is said for every 100 persons who tested positive for steroÃ¯d use, just 16 were using steroid. In order to improve this test, we test again on someone who showed positive.
A person who shows up 2 time positive after 2 tests has a 64.4% chance of using steroids.
