# Study Case
## Novel Foods' Change in Operations Strategy: Competitiveness at Stake

* Novel foods group is a chain
* serve low price meals
* Takeaway or eat in front of the outlet on the roadside


1. The competitive prority was low cost food and unbeatable prices.
2. The operation strategy is to open only small outlet with 2 rooms each, 1 for preparation and stock, and the other to serve. Buying stuff from farmer at 1/2 the price on the market
3. Keep the prices low
4. They lost their competitive advantage because of trying to reach middle class people on every outlet, but this was impossible to scale and started to cost too much money to hire more people, buy new stuff.
5. To ensure its future success the company should probably stop the middle class, and focus on low class people. Not try to scale the middle class to all the outlet.

This is an economic approach (to link to what we studied today)
