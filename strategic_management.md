 * Adaptive environment
 * looking internally at what we are good at
 * Create a strategy is an interactive process where everyone is involved in
 * Strategy come from the top management team but need to involve other persons
 * _example_: IKEA as a strategic advantage: affordable stuff
 * 3 level of strategy:
	 * corporate level
		 * overall purpose and scope of an organisation & how to business units
	 * business level
		 * divisional managers and stuff
	 * Functional level
		 * Functional managers , workers, etc
	 *  Different levels of manager must give a competitive advantage over other company, through strategic leadership taking in consideration the _social responsibility_ of there acts.
	 *  Strategic making:
		 * Select the mission
		 * Look outside & identify strategic opportunity
		 * analyze internal competitive environment & strengths & weakness
		 * select the strategy

> Strategic is not static, always feedback loop is the most important

Communicate to employees our vision and why they works for us is really important.


Concentrate resources on the most critical things

####Exercise: IKEA Strategy case study:

* Describe what is meant by the SWOT analysis
* Explain the differences between internal & external factors
* analyse ways in which IKEA has managed the minimize threats to its business
* discuss the contribution of SWOT analysis to IKEA's growth

_Study case Home Grocer_

* SWOT:
	* Strength
		* Online market
		* Strong industry
	* Weakness
		* No subcontracting (truck, warehouse)
		* Low accessibility to internet in houses (act as if everyone has internet)
	* Opportunities
		* New type of market (online)
	* Threat
		* Unstable market
		* Society behaviors
			* lazy people if buy online, not a good practice


# Analyzing the external environment

* External environment in the SWOT is represented by
	* Opportunities
		* Identify and use it
	* Threat
		* Identify to avoid

## Important points (5)

* Economies of scale
	* More production cost less per unit
* Brand Loyalty
* Absolute cost advantage
	* A company in the game, cost less than one entering = advantage
	* Can be money advantage, like production cost, but also skill
*  Customer switching costs
	* Like apple user switching to android: it cost time to the customer to switch
* Tactic price collusion
	* Competitive company accord they price in informal way
* Substitude products and complementors
	* Product that add value to a main product of the company
		* ex: Phone cover when selling phones

### Competitive Force Model
* Risk of entry
*  Bargaining power of buyers
* Power of complement providers
* Threat of substitutes
* Bargaining power of suppliers

Macro environment analysis (PEEST) :

* Political
* Economic
* Ecological / Environment
* Social / CUltural
* Technological


* Oportunities
* Threat

* Resources
	* Tangible resources: physical entities, land, building, money, inventory
	* Intangible resources: non physical resources created by managers and other employees
* Resources are really valuable when they enable a company to create strong demand for its products and to lower it costs.

A Company advantage is based on three factors:
* The value customers place on the company's products
* The price that a company charges for its products
* The cost of creating those



##Case study: Trader Joe's

* ? Undertake an internal analysis
	* ? Identify strengths and weakness
	* Strengths
		* R&D
		* Distinctive by shopping experience
		* Location _(place where they know people like them, educated, adventurous peoples)_
		* Strict sanitary checks _(moved from china because of bad food storage conditions)_
		* Privately hold company _(can hold they secrets)_
	* Weakness
		* Privately hold company _(can't grow as they wants)_
		* Logistics
* ? What is Trader competitive advantage, if any ?
	* Customer loyalty _(put a big value in they products)_
	* Distinctive product strategy _(narrow range but great products)_
*  ? Make recommondations
	* Be a semi-public company to grab other investments but still keep they secrets
	* Low display like Sprout Farmers Market _(because of the little room for waste or error)_
	* Pay policies, _(pay employee more to preserve they worker and the culture)_
	* Increase price as people trust they products _(like apple first was "do more, cost less" but now cost a lot)_

## Stakeholders

* Mission statement
	* What business are we in ?
	* How do we make a difference ?
	* Why do we do this ?
* The vision
	* What to achieve
	* Motivate employees
* Values
	* How employees should conduct themeselfs
	* Establish the basics of the organisation culture
* Governance help to separate ownership and management
* Difference between interest of the governance and the managers can create issues
	* Manager act in his own interest instead of the company interest serving the vision of the owner
* IS a decision ethics ? :
	* Does my decision fall within the accepted values or std that typically apply in the organisational environment ?
	* am i willing to see the decision communicated to all stakeholders accepted by it ?
	* Would the people with whom I have a significant personal relationship, such as family, or even managers in other organisation approve of the decisions ?

# Functional level and business - Level strategies

## Functional-level Strategy
> _Functional-level_: Is actions that manager take to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of one or more of value reation activities.

* To improve effectivevness of a company and operations

> _Economy of scale :_ reducing cost by increasing the quantity of sold product

* Achieving superior efficiency
	* Economy of scale
	* Felexible manufacturing technologies instead of standard mass production
		* ie: DELL: laptop etc that are customization
	* Just in time systems for logisitcs
	* R&D that produce products easy to manufacture
	* Upgrade employee skills
	* Self-managing teams
	* link pay to performances
	* design structure to increase cooperations between services

	*  ie: 3M, Apple, Intel

 customer responsiveness :  efficiency : quality : innovation + R&D

With good __innovation and R&D__ comes a good __efficiency__ (not wasting time to fix errors etc)
With good __quality__ comes a good __customer responsiveness__

## Business-level Strategy

# Business Level Strategy
[http://smallbusiness.chron.com/five-types-business-level-strategies-781.html](Business level strategy)

* Still useful in declining industry if managers can figure out the right strategy
* good strategy is aiming niche market where demand is strong is good for declining industry to raise again

## Fragmented Industry

> It is a large number of small & medium sized companies _ie: restaurants industry_

* It is a low barrier entrance industry
* It is fragmented because of lack of economies of scale
* Easy for entrepreneurs to come into
* **Value Innovation**
	* allow greater value through superior differentiation at a lower cost
	* _aka: critical thinking, take a step back, and see the overall thing and **play the game differently**_
		* _ie: AirBnB changed the way hotel & everything were working for 100+ years and innovate on it_
*  Consolidate a fragmented industry can be done through **franchising & chaining**
* **Chaining** can help to become rapidly a national brand

## Survive through different stage of life cycle

### Transition between embryonic to growth

* Customer demand is limited
	* Unfamiliar with the product
	* Don't know what to expect
	* Don't need it
	* Lack of complementary
		* Like iPhone at the start has on case or bumpers etc...
* Become growth industry as the mass market develops for the firm's product
	* Help to reduce cost of production
* customers of a product: Innovators -> early adopters -> early majority -> late majority
* six competitors forces
* product proliferation
* Go on every segments of the market to be harder for competitors to come
	* Like Google Pixel and Google Pixel cheap version
	* WallMart lower the prices by 50% when a now competitor go near one of their market
*  Strategic commitments
* Have an aggressive advertising to remember everyone you are on the top of the other
*  Price leadership
	* Free Mobile changed everything
* non-price competition
	* expends to more segments of its existing market
	* create new or improve products with strong R&D
		* Announce a product that is not yet ready for sale is widely used
	* Finding new market segments
	* Product proliferation
		* Pixel / Pixel Cheap

![Figure 6.9 strategy selection in a declining industry](http://images.slideplayer.com/16/4942974/slides/slide_23.jpg)

* Explenation of figure 6.9
	* Become a leader of the declining industry taking leadership
	* Niche strategy: focus on pockets of demand that decline more slowly than the whole industry
	* harvest strategy reduce cost structure, reduce to minimum the assets and get what you can, then leave
	* Just sells the business and leave

# Functional and business level strategies

* functionnal level strategy helps to build competitive advantage that are:
	* efficiency
	* quality
	* innovation
	* customer responsiveness

 ## Functional level strategy

> action that managers tale to imporove the effectiveness of one or more of value creation activities

* they are resources that create values
* efficiency = output / input
	*  the more efficient, the fewer the inputs required to produce a given output, therefore lower the cost structure
* how to increase efficiency
	* exploiting economies of scal & _learning effects : the more you do, the better you become with experience)_
	* adopting flexible manufacturing technologies
		* instead of mass production do custom mass production
			* _ie DELL: produce pc all custom but in mass_
	* implement just in time system
	* reduce customer defection rate
	* introduce self-managing teams
		* side effect: employee are more motivated by managing themself, feels more in the job
* Achieve superior quality
	* quality could be
		* reliability
		* excellence
			* Differentiate by attribute like form, features, performance, durability, styling
			* improve the marketing to play on that: prompt delivrery, easy installation, etc...
			* the company need to be seen as superior to that of rivals
	* superior quality provide
		* helps to differentiate its products from those offered by rivals -> induce creation of value in the eyes of customers
		* eleminating defects or errors from theproduction process -> remove waste
	* [Six sigma](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Six_Sigma) metrics to mesure production quality
* Achieve superior innovation
	* innovation can be in __products__ or in __process__
	* differentitate product and therefore chare premium price
		* exampmle: Apple
	* lower the cost structure
	* marketing and technology needs to works together
		* example of fail: segway: even with both, something went wrong: price !
* Achieve superior customer responsiveness
	* give them what they want when they want at the price they want
	* if we have brand loyalty
		* we can increase demande
		* do premium prices
	* give the customers value for money

## Business level strategy

* it's about _whom_ the company decides to serve (which customer segments), what customer need & desires the company is trying to satisfy & how the company decide it to do
* low cost / differentiation
* low cost
	* raw materials company can't really play on that
	* can help to undercut the rival's prices
	* _ie: wall mart_
* diffentiation
	* distinguishing company from its rivals by offerint something that is hard to find and match
	* differentied by
		* superior quality
		* better design
		* easy of use
		* customer services
	* this give 2 advantages
		* charge premium price
		* increase demand
	* can help a comapny grow overall demand and capture market
	* figure 5.1 options for exploiting diffrentitation
	* it sometime raise the cost structure of the firm
	* there is a balance between differentiation and low cost
		* uber disrupted that by creating real innovation
* Think how to segment market
	* not tailer different offering to different segments so sell strandarized stuff
	* regognise difference and create products for each segment
	* target a limited nnumber of market segment
* To create value while we differentiate, instead of increasing price, create demand
	* If people find a product at fair price with good quality, they'll want to buy it feeling doing a good deal

## Corporate level strategy

* Vertical integration = own the suply chain

### Horizontal Integration

#### Advantages

* hrizontal = aquire & merge with industry competitors (like coca cola buying wine production etc)
* aquire competitor with != products so we can offer more stuff of != range
	* _ie: the laptop industry: buy the laptop, the case, the mouse, office365 at the same time & same place_
* Leveragind the resources
	* we are good to sell one product, what if we try to sell the product of another company as we are good to do that
* Reduce industry rivalry
	* Buy acquiring or merging with competitor
* Increase bargaining power against buyers & suppliers
	* buy more raw material, can negociate the price

#### Problems

* Problems with merging very != company cultures
* High turnover when the aquisition is forced
* overestimate the potential benefits ?
* Very regulated in the EU


### Vertical Integration: Entering New Industries to strengthen the __core__ business model

* Backward or upstream integraetion
	* producing it's own products
		* _ie IBM producing its own products to create computers_
* Forward or downward integration
	* Sell by yourself the products
		* _ie: Apple_
* 4 stages of creating value in the chain
	* Figure 9.1 Stages in the Raw-Material-to-Customer Value-Added Chain
*

#### Advantages

* Facilitates investments in specialized assets
	* can be a special knowledge of certain employee or so
	* _ie Ford designed a new electrical engine, but it's not they core job, but will help them save a lot of money, therefore create a competitive advantage_
		* the problem is Ford doesn't know if they can trust the production suppliers
* Protect product quality
* Results in improved scheduling

#### Problems

* Increase cost structure
	* if you still buy stuff from your own suppliers whent new suppliers arrive in the marcket at a lower price
		* _ie Ford with iron ore mining_
	* burocratic costs
* Disadvantage when technology change fast
	* lock the company in an old technology
* when demande is unpredictable
	* Hard to manage the volume and the flow

#### Alternatives to Vertical integration: Cooperative Relationship

* Enter in long term relationship instead of buying / owning another company can allow to avoid the burocratic problem
	* _ie Apple with Foxconn, Apple invested in the production equipment for Foxconn_
* How to build that kind of long term relationship
	* Each part invest in eachother
	* Hostage taking
		* let other know some of the patented stuff so if you broke the relation they can sell it to another
	* Credible commitments
		* If one part fail, it break the image of the both
