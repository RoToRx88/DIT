#Strategic Information System

> assignment from 1 to 29 of march
> _news to read_ : Harvard business review / â‚¬ management journal

* Technology is just a component, not a finality in an organisation


## What's an information System: IS
> _IS:_ An organizational system that enables the processing & management of an organization's information
> _Information System:_ Collect, process, store, and distribute information


**IS != IT**
IS is not about technology _ie: IS of an hostel could be paper before the computer arrived_

* Technology: enable and constrain
* Process: Multiple ways to perform activity:
	* _ie: chek-in at a hotel_
* people: persons directly involved in the IS
* structure: hierarchy, functional, communication, reward mechanisms, culture
* __Changing a component, you affect the other components of the model__
* IS & organisational change: automate -> informate -> transofrm

* 3 basics levels
	* Operational
		* high level, decision of vision etc
	* Management
		* Manage executive, report informations to operational
	* Executive
		* Execute basics tasks like a cashier
*  in a process, there is many steps to process the into and get an output from it
* Not buy an ERP and adapt our process because we lose what we do that is unique
	* Find the good ERP to what we do is better
*  Customer relationshop management (CRM)
	* Helps to understand what the customer wants / buy and then present what he wants for example
* 3 levels of actions we can play on
	*  hierarchical
	* functional
	* process

**Security is important, KeyWord actually**
We secure cars and houses, it is the same for online stuff etc...

# The changing Competitive Environment

* Value in scarcity
  * the value of a good is function of its limited availability
* value in plentitude
  * the value of a network is a function of the number of connected nodes
  * _ie if you are the only one to have a fax, not valuable, if everyone have one, valuable_

> The value of a network is function of the number of node inside this network

* positive feedback works very well on interner
  * _ie someone by a bike in kit, says it is easy to build and use_
* people chose a network, not a service provider
  * _ie facebook, people access it from any platform (aka service provider), but still use facebook (aka network)_
* products baught only to access the content on them will be replaced by digital systems
  * K7 -> netflix
  * book -> readers
  * iPod -> spotify
* information is not the carrier, technology is
* TODO: check European innovation academy EIA program
